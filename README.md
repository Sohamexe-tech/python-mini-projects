## 📝 Best Practices

When working with these projects:

1. **Version Control**: Always use Git for tracking changes
2. **Virtual Environments**: Use venv or conda to manage dependencies
3. **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8 and use linters (pylint, flake8)
4. **Documentation**: Write clear docstrings and comments
5. **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks
6. **Testing**: Test your code with various inputs
7. **Security**: Never commit API keys or passwords (use .env files)

## 🔒 Security Note

**Important**: Never commit sensitive information!

- Use `.env` files for API keys and secrets
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables
- Don't hardcode passwords or tokens

Example `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Load in Python:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
```
